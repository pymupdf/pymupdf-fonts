        Introduction
        ============
        
        This is a collection of fonts that can be used by PyMuPDF applications for writing text to PDFs.
        
        The fonts are provided encoded in compressed base64 format, wrapped as Python variables.
        
        The primary motivation for this approach is two-fold: (1) keep the PyMuPDF binary module size within reasonable limits and (2) enable inclusion of fonts not supported as part of PyMuPDF itself. We may extend this package with more Google's NOTO fonts and others over time.
        
        Currently the following fonts are provided:
        
        * **FiraGO** -- font family, sans serif **proportional** fonts with support for 68 languages and the following scripts: Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, Georgian and Devanagari. Support for the variants Regular, Bold, Ialic and Bold-Italic. Use this font as a viable "universal" alternative to the "Droid Sans Fallback Regular" font, which is included in the PyMuPDF package (embedded in the binary extension module).
        * **FiraMono** -- font family, sans serif **mono-spaced** fonts with support for dozens of languages and the scripts Latin, Cyrillic, Greek. Supports the weights Regular and Bold (no Italic). Can be used instead of Courier for a nicer look.
        * **Space Mono** -- a nice and small-sized mono-spaced font family. Space Mono is an original fixed-width type family designed by Colophon Foundry for Google Design. It supports a Latin Extended glyph set, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages. Part of Google Fonts and also licensed under SIL OFL v1.1. Supports Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold-Italic.
        * **NOTO Sans** -- Google font family similar to Helvetica. Supports Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold-Italic.
        * **NOTO Music** -- Google font for musical symbols.
        * **NOTO SANS Math** -- Google font for mathematical symbols.
        * **NOTO Symbols** and **NOTO Symbols2** -- Google symbol fonts.
        * **Ubuntu** font families, which provide sans-serif proportional and mono-spaced fonts with a look familiar to Ubuntu users. They are licensed under a slightly different license - see below - which nonetheless offers a similar degree of freedom as the OFL.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        pymupdf-fonts is a pure Python package provided as a wheel. As such it is Python version independent.
        
        Usage and Documentation
        ========================
        
        How to use fonts in general is described in detail in the PyMuPDF documentation. The basic instruction is ``font = fitz.Font("key")``, where "key" is one of the Base-14 or CJK **font codes**, like "helv", "cour" or "cjk".
        
        Once this package is installed, PyMuPDF makes these fonts automatically and seamlessly available as **additional font codes**, for example ``font = fitz.Font("figo")`` for "FiraGO Regular". You do not need to import this package separately yourself. To see a list of additionally available font codes, type ``print(fitz.fitz_fontdescriptors.keys())``.
        
        But you can access font information of this package **also without PyMuPDF:** just ``import pymupdf_fonts``. Its dictionary ``fontdescriptors`` equals ``fitz_fontdescriptors`` above. For example, to access the fontfile's binary content of "FiraGO Regular", execute ``fontbuffer = pymupdf_fonts.fontbuffers["figo"]()`` (a bytes object).
